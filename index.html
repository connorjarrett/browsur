            Browsur makes the things you do most on your computer even worse, with
            useless new ways to get less done, immerse yourself in next-level frustration,
            and take no advantage of your other devices.

                Browsur is... something, I guess? It has some apps, but they're probably not as good as what you're used to. And who needs Microsoft 365 or Adobe Creative Cloud when you have... a file explorer. No matter who you are, or what you want to do, Browsur probably can't do it either.

                            Introducing Explorer, the most basic and outdated file explorer ever created. With its limited features and clunky
                            interface, Explorer will take you back to the Stone Age of computing. Forget about intuitive navigation or advanced
                            search functions - Explorer will make you feel like you're solving a puzzle every time you need to find a file.
                            <br><br>
                            But that's not all. Explorer also comes with the added bonus of being extremely vulnerable to malware and viruses,
                            making it the perfect tool for hackers and cybercriminals. So not only will you have a terrible user experience, but
                            you'll also be putting your entire system at risk!

                            Browsur brings you Slugari, the web browser, inside the browser,
                            so that you can surf the web without having to leave

                            Slugari cleans the clutter of the web by only supporting a
                            few webpages. This is definitely by design and nothing to do
                            with a lack of external iframe support on most websites.

            <p>
                Browsur brings the most primitive security of any personal computer
                to your browser. Browsur comes with built-in bugs that make it easy for
                malware and viruses to infect your session, and it gives you the freedom
                to share everything with everyone. Passkeys? Nope, just use your simple
                and insecure passwords. File encryption? No such thing, all your data is up for
                grabs. So no matter what you're doing, Browsur helps your private
                information become public.
